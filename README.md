# airQualityProject

## Description
This program is designed to process data from the Ohio Univeristy 'AirWall Project' 
It takes the average of a handful of selected cells in the provided data, but could easily be modified to average more cells or the entire table

Please feel free to use or modify this code as needed, I've made an effort to document it for future contributors.

## Usage
I've tried to make this program as user friendly as possible.
To use it, just dump all of the raw data .csv files into the 'rawData' folder, then run the 'processData.py' file.
The program will automatically find all of the data files, process them, and then get a readout of how many files were processed and how many failed to process

## Requirements
- Python
- 'csv' and 'glob' libraries for python

If you're having trouble getting the program to run and can't figure out why, feel free to email me at ch94811@ohio.edu
